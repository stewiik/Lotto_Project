# Lotto Project

**Lotto Project** is a Spring Boot-based backend web application implementing a lottery game. Users can provide six unique numbers (within the range 1-99) to generate a unique lottery ticket identified by a hash. The system generates winning numbers weekly, validates user submissions, and announces results. It uses NoSQL database (MongoDB) for tickets and results repositories.
